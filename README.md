at Bogaziçi University.

# The wolower
It is possible to use your Twitter account to sell some of your belongings, 
but there is a significant problem when you want to sell and buy something
on Twitter, that is payment. Twitter does not provide a social payment
infrastructure. Sure you consider that there is an option to pay at the door, 
but it is not useful for international sales. You cannot expect from someone
abroad to accept the payment on behalf of you, right!. A trusted, secure,
and automated payment mechanism is needed. 
**The wolower engages right here!**

## Screenshots

### Masterpass Pairing
The wolower uses Masterpass to provide you a secure, trusted payment mechanism.
The wolower assures you that it will never ever know your credit card
number. To be honest, we do not care your credit card!

### New Product
The wolower has two different types of entries, one of them is a product. 
If you want to sell something on your Twitter account, the only thing you will
do is to mention "wolower_payment" twitter account when sharing your product 
with its price.

### New Order
The other type of entries for the wolower is an order. 
If you love something brilliant being sold on Twitter, the only thing you will do
is to reply that tweet it with your order (with how much are you willing to pay).
